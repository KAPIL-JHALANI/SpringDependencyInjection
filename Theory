How @Autowired works ??
ans: first it check with autowire="bytype"  if it found then it just inject the object otherwise it go and find object with autowire="byname"
So when we use byname:  so basically if we have multiple objects of same class in ioc then it fails with bytype and then it cheked with byname

why we use @aurowired?
ans: so that dependency injection handle by spring and we do not need t write code in beans.

** Autowiring is not possible for string ot primite data types. It only used for objects only.

@Qualifie annotaion ??
ans: used for specifying which beans you want to used if you have multiple objects of same class.


** autowire does not need setter method to do deency inject if we directly put @Autowired over the object.

Value and required use
@value use for injecting the primitive data literal values
@Required   making the field required ,  if this value is not inject then object do not created  (this annotation is deprecate after version 5.1 ad you may use constructor injection if you want to use required field)
